This project is about Ray Tracer.

My porpose is to build a simple use, fast and beautiful Ray Tracer.

At the moment, I use the Qt 4.7 to display the image generated by tis Ray Tracer.I will use the OpenCV2.2 to deal with the image later. I also want to use the TBB3 to do the multicore computing later and build a custom Shader to render it.
